                My name is Julissa Zavala and I am currently based in Queens,
                New York (where I’m from!).
                <span className="info-bio-detail">
                  I’m a Product Designer with four years of experience creating
                  tools for a range of users, from teachers and guidance
                  counselors to shelter directors, at New Visions for Public
                  Schools.

                  Good design should feel seamless, almost invisible.
                  <br />
                  But the process to get there isn’t always straightforward;
                  every solution comes from conversations, decisions, and
                  countless iterations. The hidden work behind every great
                  design has always pulled me in, and that process is what keeps
                  me learning and growing as a designer. I take pride in the
                  details, knowing they add up to something meaningful. For me,
                  design is about creating solutions that make people’s lives
                  easier, while also keeping the bigger picture in focus so the
                  work meets business goals with clarity and purpose.

              When I’m away from my computer, you can usually find me in the
              kitchen trying out new recipes, going on long walks with my dog
              Penny, or more recently, learning how to dance salsa.

            <p className="info-bio-details-3">
              I also really enjoy hands-on creative work like sketching,
              painting and ceramics. Here’s some recent ceramics projects I’ve
              been working on, at various point of WIP!
